    - turn count


[ wholly unimplemented yet necessary features ]


turn file format, either:
    - conversion script to convert a turn file into our json format
    - rejigger the initialization to use a regular turn file

stacked tiles
    - icons to represent a stack?
        * different icons for different types of stacks, like one icon for all of one type and
          and one for multiple types?
        * one unit is in front, but has a "stack" border, like a deck of cards, to indicate
          it's part of a stack
    - how do we see all the units in a stack?
        * click on the stack, which fans out all the units available, then we click the one
          we want, which brings it to the forefront. each unit in the fan should have its
          choosen action visible, if one has been choosen. during the fan, darken/gray-out the
          rest of the board?

actions that happen over multiple turns
    - cities take x number of turns to be built
        * in icons: a seperate icon for each stage of the building? would be annoying to update
          when that mechanic changes, like from 2 turns to 3 turns. a grayed out city with a
          timer number on it? maybe just one seperate icon for "city under construction" with
          a timer number?
        * in code: cities under construction are essentially non-actionable units. separate
          them completely from regular cities, they're a different unit.
    - armies may take time to build
        * until the army is built, the city can't select any new actions. but a city can
          interrupt its action and choose to build something new, in which case progress is
          lost.
    - both of these situations may be variations of the same problem: building something over
      multiple turns, and whether it can be interrupted or not.
        * a city under construction could be represented as a settler with a "building" sign.
        * or, a city under construction could be represented as a city with an "under
           construction" sign.
        * same thing for cities building other units.
        * if the building is interuptible, then we can click on unit, select the "X" icon,
          which turns it back into the regular unit. if the user wants to "uninterrupt" it,
          they can choose that building icon, and it'll go back to "under construction."

game selector
    - a wholly seperate page
    - presents a list of games going on, with who's playing in each
    - lets us log into the game we want, as the user we want
    - obviously, some kind of authentication. nothing big on our end, since we're in unsafe
      client-side-land anyways.
