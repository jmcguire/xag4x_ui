add action selection to action icons (arrows and mini-icons)
    - red icons for attacks, orange icons for possible attacks?

action icons should have colored rollover

unselected tiles should show their currently selected action, maybe an icon grayed out?

implement footer
    - turn count
    - submit turn - polls all units for current plater and creates a player turn file


[ wholly unimplemented yet necessary features ]


turn file format, either:
    - conversion script to convert a turn file into our json format
    - rejigger the initialization to use a regular turn file

stacked tiles
    - icons to represent a stack?
        * different icons for different types of stacks, like one icon for all of one type and
          and one for multiple types?
        * one unit is in front, but has a "stack" border, like a deck of cards, to indicate
          it's part of a stack
    - how do we see all the units in a stack?
        * click on the stack, which fans out all the units available, then we click the one
          we want, which brings it to the forefront. each unit in the fan should have its
          choosen action visible, if one has been choosen. during the fan, darken/gray-out the
          rest of the board?

game selector
    - a wholly seperate page
    - presents a list of games going on, with who's playing in each
    - lets us log into the game we want, as the user we want
    - obviously, some kind of authentication. nothing big on our end, since we're in unsafe
      client-side-land anyways.
